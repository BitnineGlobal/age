PostgresClientKit provides a high-performance and scalable solution for accessing PostgreSQL databases, which are used as the storage backend for Apache Age. The driver leverages the features of PostgresClientKit to provide a reliable and efficient interface for accessing Apache Age's graph data.


With Apache Age Swift Driver, developers can leverage the power of Apache Age's graph processing capabilities to build graph-based applications in Swift. This can be particularly useful for applications that involve social networks, recommendation systems, fraud detection, and other use cases where relationships between entities are important.
