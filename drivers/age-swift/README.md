# Apache Age Swift Driver

The Apache Age Swift Driver is a library that allows Swift developers to interact with Apache Age, a graph database built on top of PostgreSQL. This driver leverages the capabilities of the PostgresClientKit library to provide a seamless integration with Apache Age and enables the execution of basic PostgreSQL operations.

## Features

- Connect to an Apache Age graph database using a PostgresClientKit connection.
- Execute basic PostgreSQL operations such as querying, inserting, updating, and deleting data.
- Utilize the power of Apache Age's graph database capabilities to perform graph-specific operations.
- Leverage the familiar syntax and functionality of Swift while interacting with the Apache Age database.

## Prerequisites

Before using the Apache Age Swift Driver, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Swift 5.0 or later
- Apache Age
- PostgreSQL

## Installation

You can add the Apache Age Swift Driver to your Swift project using Swift Package Manager (SPM).
