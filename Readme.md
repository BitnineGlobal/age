# Apache AGE-Viewer in Golang
This is the project in which we are developing Age-Viewer from scratch in GoLang whereas existing system is bulit in Javascript and React. Here you found existing Age-Viewer : https://github.com/apache/age-viewer . After reviewing neo4j(tool used for graph visulaization) found important functions that should be implemented in our Age-Viewer.

# Features:
- Start window (where it checks system requirements,runtime envirnmont,distributions and many more) that is in processing in our current Age-Viewer in command prompt while it's running.
- Home screen should be prompt after successful checks of start window.
- Home screen should have list of projects, example project(for demo purpose), DBMS, Graph Apps,Developer tools etc.
- Design and Colour Schemes for the frontend part.
- Alignment and Scaling of different buttons,tables and other overall pages.
- Responsive design for all Screen Resolutions
- Language support (i.e. English, Korean etc)
- Query Translation for the processing.
