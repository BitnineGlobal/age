Description: Apache AGE is an extension for PostgreSQL that enables users to leverage a graph database 
  on top of the existing relational databases. It is a PostgreSQL extension that provides graph database functionality.
  The goal of Apache AGEÂ® is to provide graph data processing and analytics capability to all relational databases.
  Through Apache AGE, PostgreSQL users will gain access to graph query modeling within the existing relational database.
  Users can read and write graph data in nodes and edges. They can also use various algorithms such as variable length and 
  edge traversal when analyzing data.
